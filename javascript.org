* JS Box metrics
<<sec:js-box-metrics>>

There are several concepts of metrics used in javascript.

** CSS width/height

Without =box-sizing: border-box= being set, it is the size of the
_content area_, which lies inside the padding. CSS properties can be
set using =element.style= property and retrieved using
=getComputedStyle()/currentStyle=.

** clientWidth/Height

Size of the =client area=: content area with padding, but without scrollbars.

#+begin_example
  clientWidth = CSS-width + paddings - scrollbar-width;
  clientHeight = CSS-height + paddings - scrollbar-height;
#+end_example

NOTE: the scrollbars will first occupy the padding area, and if the
padding area is not large enough, it will further occupy the content
area, meanwhile the CSS width/height stays unchanged. Thus as in the
following image where =padding > scrollbar-width=:

[[http://javascript.info/files/tutorial/browser/dom/metric2.png]]

The size can be calculated:
#+begin_example
  clientWidth = 300(width) + 40(paddings) - 16(scrollbar) = 324
  clientHeight = 200(height) + 40(paddings) = 240
#+end_example

However, if the =padding < scrollbar-width=:

[[http://javascript.info/files/tutorial/browser/dom/metricClientWidth.png]]

The _CSS width_ stays unchanged(300px), while the client width:

#+begin_example
  clientWidth = 300(width) + 0(paddings) - 16(scrollbar) = 284
#+end_example

Thus the =clientWidth/clientHeight= reflect the real size of the content.

** scrollWidth/Height
Content area width and height _including_ the scrolled out part. That
means they are the same as clientWidth/Height, but includes full
scrollable area.

** scrollTop/scrollLeft
The size of scrolled out part: vertical and horizontal. The value is
always in pixels.

NOTE that you can set values to this property, the browser will scroll
the document accordingly.

** offsetWidth/Height
Outer box width/height, full size with borders, but without margins.

** clientTop/Left
The indent of _client area_ from box outer corner.

Normally, the value is:
#+begin_example
clientTop = border-top-width
clientLeft = border-left-width
#+end_example

However, in case of a _right-to-left_ document, where the scrollbar
appears on the top and left, the value is:
#+begin_example
clientTop = border-top-width + scrollbar-width
clientLeft = border-left-width + scrollbar-width
#+end_example

** offsetParent, offsetLeft/Top
Properties =offsetLeft= and =offsetTop= reflects a relative shift of
an element from its =offsetParent=.

The =offsetParent= is the closest(nearest in the containment
hierarchy) *positioned* containing element. If the element is
non-positioned, but the ancestor is a table cell(=td=, =th= or
=table=) or root element (=html= in standards compliant mode; =body=
in quirks rendering mode) is the =offsetParent=. See
[[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom-view/#dom-htmlelement-offsetparent][DOM
HTML Element -- offsetparent]] for specification.

** Summary
1. The _CSS width/height_ is the width of the content area, and will
   stick to the value it is.
2. The =Client Area= is the content area plus padding, but do not include
   the scrollbar.
3. The =Offset Area= is the whole content of an element except the margin.
4. All the width/height and left/top properties are calculated
   according to what they are(client/offset area).

* JS Position/Offset

The [[sec:js-box-metrics][previous section]] introduced the box model
of javascript. However, there are still two important requirement we
have: get the position of current element.

Two concept will be involed here: document and viewport.

[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Document][Document]]
serves as an entry point into the web page's content(The DOM
tree). You can treat it as the =<html>= object in HTML source
code. And JS provide a variable =document= for it.

[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport][Viewport]]
represents a polygonal(normally rectangular) area in computer graphics
currently being viewed. So we can treat it as the browser that
displays contents. 

I actually cannot distinguish viewport from
[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window][window]],
it seems that viewport is an abstract concept that refer to any
view-able area, while window refers to the actual "physical" object.

Because the window size can scroll, so the position of an element
could be relative to either document or viewport.

As for those relative to the *viewport*, JS provide us a handy function:
[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect][getBoundingClientRect()]]
that will return the size of an element and its position relative to viewport.

As for those relative to the *document*, JS do not have direct answer,
however the JQuery function [[http://api.jquery.com/offset/][.offset]]
is an alternate to that. Of course you can implement it in plain JS as
well, You can check the JQuery implementation
[[http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v%3D1.11.2&fn%3DjQuery.fn.offset][here]].
